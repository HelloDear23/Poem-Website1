            <p>As Whitman looked at the sea, birds chirping all about,<br>
                And Duncan looked at streams of words, aching and wanting,<br>
                I looked into the shadows of streetlamps.</p>
<p>  <br> 
</p>
            <p>The darkness could be a friend.<br>
                I found that through focused fear, looking from my bedroom.<br>
                It conceals bruises, silences footsteps, and quiets the night.</p>
<p>  <br> 
</p>

            <p>Light was the enemy–<br>
                When morning came all would reset–<br>
                Cars would drive, silence would break, and school would start</p>
<p>  <br> 
</p>

            <p>No, night needed nothing but your thoughts.<br>
                Your brain could beam images in the darkness, with a world better than before.<br>
                Apologies would be said, fathers would leave, and children would wail.</p>
<p>  <br> 
</p>

            <p>Daydreams are wispy at best–<br>
                Fragile like glass figurines–<br>
                Words would be forgotten, ideas would be flying, and mental grasp would be weak</p>
<p>  <br> 
</p>

            <p>The yellow light makes the black bolden.<br>
                The shapes become forms and couplets.<br>
                Tears would be metaphors, drinks would be page breaks, and screams would be rhymes.</p>
<p>  <br> 
</p>
            <p>As the sea whispered me,<br>
                And kingdom or salvation or freedom is never known,<br>
                The shadows of streetlamps offer lullabies to a tortured soul.</p>
