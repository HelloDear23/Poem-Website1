            <p> I have a joy that is hungry.<br>
                It gnaws at my chest cavity with malignant glee, <br>
                Forcing deranged giggles from my throat. <br>
                I feel my grin bare its ugly teeth.
            </p>
            <div class="COVID"> </div>
            <p>
                I try to hide this hunger. <br>
                Tuck my pointed teeth under my lip, <br>
                Making sure that I have the right number of teeth.
            </p>
            <div class="COVID"> </div>
            <p>
                Yet I know that the hunger will always show.<br>
                It will be by the glint in my eye,<br>
                A red tint that pierces like a knife. 
            </p>
            <div class="COVID"> </div>
            <p>
                The hunger is a part of me. <br>
                I have starved so long for brightness, <br>
                That it becomes dark when I finally grasp it. <br>
                My joy is starving.
