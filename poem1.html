            <p>I think my house is haunted.<br>
                I swear, there’s a spirit there,<br>
                Or maybe I just can’t recall.</p>
                <div class="COVID"></div> 
            <p>I go into rooms and things aren’t how I remember,<br>
                My clothes are on my bed instead of in my closet,<br>
                My dishes are half-put, half-left,<br>
                And all my cabinets are open.<br>
                Or maybe I just can’t recall.</p>
                <div class="COVID"></div> 
            <p>I think it possesses me too.<br>
                It sucks my energy from me, or fills me with the brim to it.<br>
                It stills my hand and freezes my heart, with my head a helpless onlooker.<br>
                How can I do these tasks, these daily chores and deadlines,<br>
                When I am haunted?<br>
                Or maybe I just can’t recall</p>
                <div class="COVID"></div> 
            <p>I’ve sought professionals.<br>
                They salt and burned my old bed— “the covers are holding you back!”<br>
                They salt and burned my food— “the sugars are too high!”<br>
                They salt and burned my everything until they just say,<br>
                “It’s you”<br>
                “You are too lazy, too distracted,<br>
                you just gotta try,<br>
                you aren’t trying,<br>
                TRY HARDER”.<br>
                Or maybe I just can’t recall.</p>
                <div class="COVID"></div> 
            <p>Finally a lady with a slow drawl and a Picasso in her waiting room found my ghost.<br>
                It wasn’t with EVPS, SLS, spirit boxes, or dousing rods,<br>
                But with a list and a book.<br>
                “How often you find yourself interrupting people?”<br>
                “How often do you make careless mistakes when doing a boring task?”<br>
                And every, “How often,” pulled my spirit from its grave to stare me down.</p>
                <div class="COVID"></div> 
            <p>It's ADHD, if I recall.</p>
            <p>  <br> </p>
           <div id="ADHD">
